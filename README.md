# 19CS404--SUBQUERIES-AND-VIEWS
AIM: 
To Study & Implementation of Sub queries Views 
 
# THEORY: 
SUBQUERIES: 
The query within another is known as a subquery. A statement containing a subquery is called a 
parent statement. The rows returned by subquery are used by the parent statement or in other 
words A subquery is a SELECT statement that is embedded in a clause of another SELECT 
statement 
 
You can place the subquery in a number of SQL clauses: 
1)WHERE clause 
2)HAVING clause 
3)FROM clause 
4)OPERATORS( IN.ANY,ALL,<,>,>=,<= etc..) 
 
# Types: 
1.Sub queries that return several values 
Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the 
operators in and any. 
 
2.Multiple queries 
Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of 
‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords. 
 
3.Correlated subquery 
A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is 
evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement. 
 
 
 
# VIEW: 

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains 
rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real 
tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and 
present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. A view is a virtual table, which 
consists of a set of columns from one or more tables. It is similar to a table but it does not store 
in the database. View is a query stored as an object 
  
Syntax: 
CREATE VIEW AS 
SELECT FROM relation_name WHERE (Condition) 
 
DROPPING A VIEW: 
A view can be deleted with the DROP VIEW command. 
 
Syntax: DROP VIEW ;
